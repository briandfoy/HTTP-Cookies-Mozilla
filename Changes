Revision history for Perl module HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla

2.031 2016-01-27T19:44:59Z
	* Freshen the distro, give Flavio credit, and update the expiry
	on a cookie that would make a test fail. This module has been around
	for a long time!
   * Added workaround to tests for saving cookies for addressing a
   rare race condition in the interaction with HTTP::Cookies.
   * No need to upgrade from 2.01 on. No need to upgrade from a previous
   version unless you need FireFox 3 support.

2.02 - 2008-09-02T01:59:00Z
   * (polettix) Hopefully fixed annoyances that make the test
   suite fail in Win32 platforms. Changed name to test file
   to make Windows see it properly. There's no need to upgrade
   if you already have 2.01 installed or you don't need
   FireFox 3 support.

2.01 - 2008-07-29
	* (polettix) Added support for FireFox 3 SQLite cookies file.
	There's no need to upgrade if you do not need this
	functionality, i.e. if you're not using FireFox 3 at all.

1.13 - 2007-11-28
	* One of the test cookies expired, causing a test to fail. I've
	fixed that test. There's no need to upgrade if you already have
	this installed.
